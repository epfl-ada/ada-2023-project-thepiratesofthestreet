The video footage recorded by the retrieval team and their strange deaths capture the attention of , the head of the bio-defense department , who activates `` , '' a team of five scientists who are called upon when high-level bioterror threats occur in the States . The team , headed by its creator , , investigates . They retrieve the satellite and rescue a hysterical 60-year old man and a colicky baby who have survived the outbreak . In an isolated underground laboratory , the team begins their examination of the downed satellite and the two survivors . The laboratory is powered by a small water-cooled nuclear reactor . In the event of a contamination breach , a 15-minute self-destruct sequence would be automatically initiated ; however if the activated sequence is deemed unnecessary , Major , designated by the Odd-Man , is the only person able to deactivate the sequence , using his pass key and right thumbprint . The scientists begin their analysis of the strain by recovering a sample from inside the satellite . They initially discover that the microorganism is contained within a delivery system of buckyballs , a technology more advanced than anything known at present . The team theorizes that may have an extraterrestrial origin , as it has no DNA or amino acids . The team discovers is an airborne microorganism that kills its host by entering the bloodstream through the lungs and coagulating the blood in the body , causing death within 10 seconds via a blood clot in the brain . Those who manage to survive the blood clot become insane , extremely violent and suicidal . It is revealed that the two survivors from had not been affected by because of their acidotic blood . However , all initial tests with antibiotics and chemical agents regularly used to kill other microorganisms show no effect on . news reporter becomes aware of some of the events related to the fallen satellite and . As he investigates further , , the of the , uses 's aide , , to perform assassinations to prevent knowledge of from reaching the civilian population . travels to one of the temporary outposts performing quarantine procedures , and witnesses the effects of spreading through various modes of transportation . He becomes a target of assassination due to his presence at the outpost , but manages to escape and his subordinates . In an attempt to neutralize the problem , the of the States authorizes a small tactical nuclear strike on the quarantine area in hopes of completely irradiating and destroying . When the team is informed , they realize that they have not reviewed the test results for irradiating . They find that the microorganism grows at an exponential rate when irradiated . The team alerts the , and the air-strike is called off before the pilot launches the nuclear missile . However , as the jet continues to fly over the quarantine area , the pilot reports a malfunction of the aircraft 's controls . Through video feed , the team and watch in shock and horror as all plastic components of the aircraft , including the pilot 's visor , disintegrate . The nuclear missile is re-armed , the jet and missile crash into the ground , and the missile detonates , irradiating the quarantine area .

They also realize that has mutated into several variations , with different means of spreading and different effects . As grows and mutates into more virulent forms , the team continue their tests to find a way to stop before it reaches , the closest city to the quarantine zone with an international airport . Further studies reveals is actually a sulfur-based compound . A set of tests with phages reveals that one phage has the ability to kill . However , repeated tests with this phage prove unsuccessful , causing the team to theorize that can communicate through an unknown mechanism between its separate parts . A binary code encoded on buckyball casings with potassium and rubidium atoms is also discovered . The information included the 6-digit number “ 739528 ” and the word infernus ” encoded in , and a bitmap image of a symbol with interlocking triangles . Bacillus infernus is the name of an archaebacterium found only at the thermal vents on the ocean floors . At this time was championing the new and controversial industry of thermal vent mining , and it was likely that the mining would eradicate the bacteria . The encoded information causes to realize must have a connection with , and leads to force to reveal the truth about the satellite . reveals , ” a confidential mission to examine a wormhole that had appeared near . It consisted of a satellite sent to collect organic samples , but it malfunctioned during the mission and crashed . With this information , the team infer that could have been sent from 's future , possibly because society in the future could not destroy the contagion due to a lack of a natural resource - Bacillus infernus . Tests with infernus reveal that the bacterium easily consumes and destroys because of 's sulfur structure . The team begins to grow large amounts of the bacterium in culture vats , intending to release the cultures over the quarantined area once a sufficient quantity is grown .

Eventually , enough bacteria are grown and they are sprayed over the quarantined area , eradicating all traces of from the environment . As part of a government conspiracy to preserve for future use , blackmails to keep a sample . The sample mutates and disintegrates the sample casing , setting off the lab 's contamination breach sensor and initiating the self-destruct sequence . The self-destruct sequence also causes the flashing emergency lights to turn on , triggering 's photosensitive epilepsy , which causes him to inadvertently destroy the self-destruct control panel on the lab level of the complex . With the elevators deactivated due to the self-destruct sequence , decides to climb to the control panel on the level above through the lab 's main exhaust vent . However , the pipes and other components in the vent have begun to deteriorate due to the mutation in the sample .

       " \"Waking is about an unnamed young man living an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and that eventually progresses to a state of self-reflective lucidity . For most of the film he observes quietly but later participates actively in philosophical discussions involving other characters—ranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurant-goers and friends—about such issues as metaphysics , free will , social philosophy , and the meaning of life . Other scenes do not even include the protagonist 's presence , but rather , show an isolated person or couple speaking about such topics from a disembodied perspective . Along the way , the film touches also upon existentialism , situationist politics , posthumanity , the film theory of , and lucid dreaming , and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name . Gradually , the protagonist realizes that he is living out a perpetual dream , broken up only by occasional false awakenings . So far he is mostly a passive onlooker , though this changes during a chat with a woman . After she eccentrically greets and shares her creative ideas with him , he reminds himself of his recent realization and of the fact that she must , therefore , be a figment of his own dreaming imagination . Afterwards , he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters as well ; however , he ultimately begins to despair about being utterly trapped in this unending , irresolvable state of existence . The protagonist 's final talk is with a character who looks somewhat similar to the protagonist himself and whom he briefly encountered previously , earlier on in the film . This last conversation reveals this other character 's understanding that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time ; that living is simply the individual 's constant negation of 's invitation to become one with the universe ; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality ; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life , the individual need only to accept 's invitation , though he does not explicitly explain how this is achieved . The protagonist is last seen walking into a driveway when he suddenly begins to levitate , paralleling a scene at the start of the film of a floating child in the same driveway . Unlike the child who grabbed firmly onto the handle of a nearby car , however , the protagonist uncertainly reaches toward the same handle but is too swiftly lifted above the vehicle and over the trees . He now rises into the endless blue expanse of the sky until he disappears from view altogether .\",\n",

They manage to get the antenna working just in time as the monitor shows an asteroid , twenty times bigger than the ship , coming at them from the stern . Thanks to the general , the ship manages to avoid a collision , but meteors from the asteroid kill one of the spacewalking astronauts by puncturing an airline , leaving the crew to abandon him in space . Eight months later , as the crew approaches , the general becomes increasingly disturbed , and as they come in for a landing and the `` space speed indicator '' approaches zero , he suddenly says `` We have n't the right ! '' and puts on full throttle . His son , now the captain of the mission , struggles with him , wrenches his hand from the throttle , and brings the ship in to a rough but safe landing .

Where 's the water ? ! Just then , . , who has been staring out the window yells `` Look ! '' Since it is snowing on , the crew is saved and they manage to replenish their water supply . In due course , as the launch date approaches , the seed planted sprouts into a tiny flower . The viewer infers that has water and can grow flowers ; since `` only can make a tree , '' is present on and must intend for humankind to exploit not only the Earth but also and the rest of the universe .

The ground sinks slightly under the ship and even though the ship does n't sink into the ground , it is leaning at an angle too risky to make an emergency liftoff .

As the movie closes , . , who had threatened to accuse . of murdering his own father on their return , changes his mind and decides that it would be better to forget about it and let the world remember the general not as a nutcase who tried to sabotage the flight but as a brave man `` sacrificin ' his life as he did , to bring his ship and his crew safely to a landing on the rocky desert of a new planet ! … ' end for a grand soldier .
