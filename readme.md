# Analysis of fictional worlds through movie summaries

## Abstract
Fiction : The category of literature, drama, film, or other creative work whose content is imagined and is not necessarily based on fact.
The American heritage dictionnary. 

Most films can be categorized as fiction,however, two subgenres can be distinguished : relaistic fiction and speculative fiction.

"A greater degree of adherence to realism or plausibility characterizes the umbrella genre of realistic fiction, while a lesser degree characterizes the umbrella genre of speculative fiction. Realistic fiction involves a story whose basic setting (time and location in the world) is, in fact, real and whose events could believably happen in the context of the real world. Contrarily, speculative fiction involves a story where the opposite is the case. For instance, speculative fiction may depict an entirely imaginary universe or one in which the laws of nature do not strictly apply (often, the genre of fantasy). Or, it depicts true historical moments, except that they have concluded differently than in real life or have been followed by new imaginary events (the genre of alternative history). Or, it depicts some other non-existent location or time-period, sometimes even including impossible technology or technology that defies current scientific understandings or capabilities (the genre of science fiction)" Wikipedia [1]

In our project, we want to focus on _speculative fiction_
