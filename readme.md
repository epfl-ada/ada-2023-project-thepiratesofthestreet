# Analysis of fictional worlds through movie summaries

## Abstract
From mythology to science fiction, people have always invented stories. Ability to create fiction (defined by The American heritage dictionnary as creative work whose content is imagined and is not necessarly based on real facts) is sometime even mention as a characteristic of the human race. **[I tried to find a reference article about that, I havn't found yet but it sounds cool]** 
All types of fiction invite their audience to explore real ideas, issues, or possibilities using an otherwise imaginary setting or using something similar to reality, though still distinct from it. In this study, we want to extract _speculative fiction_* from the movies dataset and analyse how imaginary worlds depicted in the movies sumary have evolved in one century. 
We will first build a dataset containing exclusively speculative fictions. A first approach will be to use the movies genres classification. Then, as the speculative caracteristic of a fiction does not necessarly appears in the genre,  we would like to use machine learning tools to detect speculative fiction from the sumaries. **[need to be detailled]**
Once we have dataset of imaginary stories, we will perform sentimental analysis to study how positive are fictional worlds over time. Moreover, by using home made words clusters first, NLP programs then, we will try to identify trends in the elements that make up these imaginary worlds
(eg fairy tale cluster: dragons, kings, princesses, wizards, once upon a time...)
 

Interesting :The distinction is further obscured by a philosophical understanding, on the one hand, that the truth can be presented through imaginary channels and constructions, while, on the other hand, works of the imagination can just as well bring about significant new perspectives on, or conclusions about, truth and reality.

"Speculative fiction (as opposed to realistic fiction) depicts an entirely imaginary universe or one in which the laws of nature do not strictly apply (often, the genre of fantasy). Or, it depicts true historical moments, except that they have concluded differently than in real life or have been followed by new imaginary events (the genre of alternative history). Or, it depicts some other non-existent location or time-period, sometimes even including impossible technology or technology that defies current scientific understandings or capabilities (the genre of science fiction)" Wikipedia [1]
